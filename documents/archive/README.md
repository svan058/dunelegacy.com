## Why Archived?

These documents were created during the investigation and migration from App Platform to Droplet. They contained:
- Redundant information
- Outdated approaches
- Multiple overlapping guides
- Analysis that's now historical

The new consolidated documentation is:
- ✅ Better organized
- ✅ AI-agent friendly
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Easier to maintain
